With LoRaWAN you can bridge 1 to 2 km in cities and even up to 10 km or more in rural areas. Distances of up to 50 km or more have even been overcome. However, this depends on various conditions, such as the height of the connected sensors, obstacles such as walls and the like. LoRaWAN has even been used in power plants, and even these thick walls could be penetrated by LoRaWAN. Because of these properties, it is finding great application in the Internet of Things field. However, the disadvantage is that the transmission time and data rate are low. However, this is always sufficient for the transmission of sensor data. Another advantage is that LoRaWAN uses a frequency range that is freely accessible and usable for everyone, so you do not have to ask permission if you want to start your own project. Only the appropriate hardware is needed. With a gateway you can for example cover your whole house.',
